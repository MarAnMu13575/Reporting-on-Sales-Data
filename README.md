# Reporting on Sales Data with Python

## Background

Welcome to the world of data analysis! In this project, you'll be leveraging your newly acquired skills in data manipulation and plotting to analyze past sales data for a company that sells motorcycle parts. The company operates three warehouses in a large metropolitan area. Your colleague has enlisted your help to analyze the sales data, with a specific focus on capturing sales by payment method and calculating the average unit price for each product line.

## Dataset

The dataset provided includes information about sales transactions, including payment method, product line, unit price, quantity, and other relevant details.

## Objectives

Your main challenge is to create a comprehensive report that addresses your colleague's questions and provides actionable insights. Here's what your report should include:

1. **Total Sales by Payment Method**: Calculate and present the total sales for each payment method. This will provide an overview of how different payment methods contribute to the company's revenue.

2. **Average Unit Price by Product Line**: Determine the average unit price for each product line. This analysis will help identify the pricing trends across different product categories.

3. **Visualizations for Questions 1 and 2**: Create visualizations such as bar charts or pie charts to visually represent the total sales by payment method and the average unit price by product line.

4. **Optional Investigations**: If you're up for a deeper dive, you can investigate further by exploring average purchase values by client type, total purchase values by product line, or any other insights that you find interesting.

5. **Summary of Findings**: Summarize your key findings and insights from the analysis. Provide actionable recommendations based on the insights.
